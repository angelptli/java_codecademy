Incrementing While Loops
------------------------
When looping through code, it's common to use a counter variable. A counter
(also known as an iterator) is a variable used in the conditional logic of the
loop and (usually) incremented in value during each iteration through the code.
For example:
//////////////////////////////////////////////
// counter is initialized
int wishes = 0

// conditional logic uses counter
whil (wishes < 3) {
    
    System.out.println("Wish granted.");
    // counter is incremented
    wishes++;

}
//////////////////////////////////////////////

In the above example, the counter wishes gets initialized before the loop with
a value of f0, then the program will keep printing "Wish granted." and adding 1
to wishes as long as wishes has a value of less than 3. Once wishes reaches a
value of 3 or more, the program will exit the loop.

So the output would look like:
/////////////////
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
/////////////////

We can also decrement counters like this:
////////////////////////////////
int pushupsToDo = 10;

while (pushupsToDo > 0) {

    doPushup();
    pushupsToDo--;

}
////////////////////////////////

Int the code above, the counter, pushupsToDo starts at 10, and increments down
one at a time. When it hits 0, the loop exits.

Instructions
------------
1. In Coffee.java, initialize an int variable called cupsOfCoffee with a value
   of 1.

2. Create a while loop that runs as long as cupsOfCoffee is less than or equal
   to 100. Important: Inside the while loop, increment cupsOfCoffee by 1 to
   prevent an infinite loop.

3. Inside the while loop above where you incremented cupsOfCoffee print the
   following:
   ////////////////////////////////
   Fry drinks cup of coffee #1
   ////////////////////////////////

   The 1 in this statement should correspond with the current value of
   cupsOfCoffee. When cupsOfCoffee is 100, this should be printed:
   //////////////////////////////////
   Fry drinks cup of coffee #100
   //////////////////////////////////

class Coffee {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // initialize cupsOfCoffee
        int cupsOfCoffee = 1;

        // add while loop with counter
        while (cupsOfCoffee <= 100) {
            System.out.println("Fry drinks cup of coffee #" + cupsOfCoffee);
            cupsOfCoffee++;
        }


    }
}
