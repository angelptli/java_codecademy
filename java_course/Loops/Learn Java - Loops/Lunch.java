Removing Elements During Traversal
----------------------------------
If we want to remove elements from an ArrayList while traversing through one,
we can easily run into an error if we aren't careful.

When an element is removed from an ArrayList, all the items that appear after
the removed element will have their index value shift by negative one - it's
like all elements shifted to the left! We'll have to be very careful with how
we use our counter variable to avoid skipping elements.

Removing An Element Using while
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When using a while loop and removing elements from an ArrayList, we should not
increment the while loop's counter whenever we remove an element. We don't need
to increase the counter because all of the other elements have now shifted to
the left.

For example, if we removed the element at index 3, then the element that was at
index 4 will be moved to index 3. If we increase our counter to 4, we'll skip
that element!

Take a look at this block of code that will remove all odd numbers from an
ArrayList. Think about what about what the value of i is, when we're increasing
the value of i, and when i < lst.size() becomes False.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
int i = 0; // initialize counter

while (i < lst.size()) {
    // if value is odd, remove value
    if (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
        lst.remove(i);
    } else {
        // if value is even, increment counter
        i++;
    }
}
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Removing An Element Using for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We can use a similar strategy when removing elements using a for loop. When
using a while loop, we decided to not increase our loop control variable
whenever we removed an element. This ensured that we would not skip an element
when all of the other elements shifted to the left.

When using a for loop, we, unfortunately, must increase our loop control
variable - the loop control variable will always change when we reach the end
of the loop (and it will usually change by 1 because we often use something
like i++.) Since we can't avoid increasing our loop control variable, we can
take matters into our own hands and decrease the loop control variable whenever
we remove an item.

For example:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
    if (lst.get(i) == "value to remove") {
        // remove value from ArrayList
        lst.remove(lst.get(i));
        // Decrease loop control variable by 1
        i--;
    }
}
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Now whenever we remove an item, we'll decrease i by 1. Then when we reach the
end of the loop, i will increase by 1. It will be like i never changed!

Note: Avoid manipulating the size of an ArrayList when using an enhanced for
loop. Actions like adding or removing elements from an ArrayList when using a
for eah loop can cause a ConcurrentModificationException error.

Instructions
------------
1. Take a look at the code placed in the main() method of the Lunch class.
   Inside the method removeAnts(), use a for loop or a while loop to iterate
   through lunchBox and remove any element that has the value "ant". Outside
   the loop, return the value of lunchBox.
================================================================================
*/
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Lunch {
 
    public static ArrayList<String> removeAnts(ArrayList<String> lunchBox) {
        // Add your code below
   

    }
 
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> lunchContainer = new ArrayList<String>();
        lunchContainer.add("apple");
        lunchContainer.add("ant");
        lunchContainer.add("ant");
        lunchContainer.add("sandwich");
        lunchContainer.add("ant");
        lunchContainer = removeAnts(lunchContainer);
        System.out.println(lunchContainer);

    }
}
